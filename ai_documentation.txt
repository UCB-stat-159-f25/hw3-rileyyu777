- "Should i also write one test for the plot_match_results? or that is fine."

--> Outputs:
You don’t have to write a test for plot_match_results() unless your instructor or rubric explicitly asks for it.
🧠 Why it’s usually excluded
plot_match_results() produces figures, not numeric output — and pytest is generally meant for checking data correctness, not visual correctness.
Testing plots would require either:

checking that the function runs without errors (no exceptions), or

verifying that the figure object exists (not the actual plot content).

Those are much less important than testing math or I/O functions.

-"why there is a egg-info?"

--> Outputs:
Excellent question — that ligotools.egg-info/ folder appears automatically when you installed your local Python package (the ligotools package) inside your repo.

Here’s what’s happening:

🧩 What ligotools.egg-info Is

When you ran:

pip install -e .


(or anything that builds your package), Python’s packaging system (setuptools) generated this ligotools.egg-info folder.

It’s basically metadata about your package, such as:

What files belong to it (SOURCES.txt)

What dependencies it lists (requires.txt)

The name, version, etc. (PKG-INFO)

The “top-level” package path

It’s how Python keeps track of your local editable install.

🧹 Should You Keep It in GitHub?

❌ No — you don’t need to keep it in your repository.

These .egg-info directories are auto-generated build artifacts, like .pyc files or __pycache__/.
They should be ignored by Git.

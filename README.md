# STAT 159 – HW 3 LIGO
**Binary Black Hole Signals in LIGO Open Data**
**Author:** Riley Yu  

This repository contains Homework 3 for *Statistics 159 (Fall 2025)* at UC Berkeley.  
In this assignment, we transformed research notebooks into a reproducible Python package and MyST website.  
The main analysis notebook is `LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb`, which demonstrates the detection of binary black hole mergers using open LIGO data.
